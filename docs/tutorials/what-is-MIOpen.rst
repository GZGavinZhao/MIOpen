What is MIOpen?
*********************

MIOpen is AMD’s deep learning primitives library, which provides highly optimized, and hand-tuned implementations of
different operators such as convolution, batch normalization, pooling, softmax, activation and layers for Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), used in both training and inference. Moreover, MIOpen is fully open-source including all its
GPU kernels; complementing AMD’s open-source ROCm stack [10]. MIOpen is the first to extend the open-source
advantage into GPU vendor libraries thereby, continuing to embark on the same ethos as the deep learning community.
